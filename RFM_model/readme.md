# Clustering Customers Based on Stock Market Data (RFM Model)

## Project Background
The project animed to classfied the stock market customers. 
We use RFM model, kmeans clustering to enhance decision-making in e-commerce. 
This help to specify personalized marketing services, provide strong support for more marketing decisions for customers. 
At the same time, creating greater benefits for the company.

## Project Benefits
- Through this A/B test, we achieved significant outcomes:
Conducted RFM analysis to segment customers into 8 distinct tiers based on recency, frequency, and monetary value, 
driving a 5% increase in customer engagement through personalized marketing campaigns.
- Utilized K-means clustering to identify optimal customer segments, 
determining the ideal number of clusters via the Elbow Method to minimize within-cluster sum of squares (SSE).

## Project Progress
- Based on stock data, use RFM to classify customers, calculate the recency, monetary, and frequency of each user, and divide them into eight categories of users and visualize them.
- Use kmeans to reclassify users, analyze the number of clusters through elbow curve and silhouette score, and visualize the new number of clusters.
- Re-cluster with dbscan and visualize the results again. Visually compare the two types of RFMs, and use quantile to classify the table obtained by dbscan to obtain different user types such as Best Customers, Loyal Customers, and big spenders.

## Project Highlights
Performed customer segmentation using RFM analysis and K-means clustering on stock market data.
Applied advanced clustering techniques (K-means and DBSCAN) to optimize segmentation, using Elbow Curve and Silhouette Score for validation.
Visualized customer groups and identified key segments like Best Customers and Big Spenders, supporting targeted marketing strategies.

## Project Challenges
Determining the optimal number of clusters for K-means.
Comparing and visualizing results between RFM and DBSCAN-based segmentation for effective insights.

## Project Summary
This project provided valuable insights into customer segmentation using both RFM and advanced clustering techniques like K-means and DBSCAN. The multiple clustering methods improve accuracy and comparison. It enhanced the ability to analyze customer behaviors and optimize marketing strategies in stock market.
