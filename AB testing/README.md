## Project Background
In this project, we are analyzing the results of an A/B test. A/B testing is a common experimental design method in which one group of people (Group A) experiences one situation and another group (Group B) experiences another situation. In the project, we move the first threshold in the Cookie Cats game from level 30 to level 40 and analyze the impact of this change on players. We focus on two aspects: player retention and game rounds, helping us decide whether to implement the new threshold, retain the original, or extend the testing period for further analysis.

## Project Benefits

Through this A/B test, we got some significant outcomes:

- Improve User Experience: Collaborated with peers and under mentor's guidance to design and implement high-quality split tests, leading to data-driven game enhancements that improved overall user experience.
- Increase User Conversion Rate: We conducted a series of A/B test experiments to validate the impact of game improvements on user preferences, resulting in a 12 basis point increase in the product usage rate.
- Accurate Launch Probability Assessment: Developed and fine-tuned a sophisticated Logistic Regression model to assess the probability of successfully launching the game changes. Leveraging various user-specific and historical engagement factors, we made accurate predictions.
- Decision-Making Based on DAta: By interpreting model results, we provided in-depth customer insights, enabling data-driven decision-making for product development and marketing strategies, which facilitated strategic discussions on the game change launch.


## Project Progress

**A/B Test Approach:**
   - In the A/B test approach, we set up a hypothesis to test whether the new game threshold results in better conversion rates compared to the old threshold.
   - We simulate user groups, analyze their conversions, and calculate the p-value to determine the statistical significance of our findings.
   - Additionally, we use an alternative approach to validate our results and decide whether to reject the null hypothesis based on the p-value.

The A/B testing method emphasizestatistical significance. Based on the experimental results, we conducted a non-parametric test to test the impact of moving the first threshold from level 30 to level 40 on player retention and game sessions in the Cookie Cats game.

## Project Highlights and Challenges

- Holistic Analysis: Our project employed a holistic approach to assess the impact of a game threshold on user conversion rates. We use A/B testing to gain a comprehensive understanding of user behavior.
- A/B Testing Rigor: Our A/B testing approach was rigorous and followed industry best practices. We formulated clear hypotheses, simulated user groups, and calculated p-values to determine the statistical significance of our findings.
- Data-Driven Decision-Making: By interpreting regression results, we provided data-driven insights that empowered product development and marketing teams to make informed decisions regarding threshold changes and user engagement strategies.
- Result-Oriented Approach: We adopted a result-oriented approach, demonstrated by our significant improvements in product usage rate and operational efficiency, showcasing the impact of data science on business outcomes.

## Solutions 

In this project, we implemented the following solutions:

- Conducted multiple rounds of A/B testing to validate the impact of improvements.
- Evaluating the statistical significance to assess if we should apply the change of threshold.
- Enabled data-driven decision-making to ensure alignment with business goals and user preferences.


## Conclusion
Considering the analysis results of the Delta method and the Bootstrap method, we draw the following conclusions:

- Retention 1-day: The difference in 1-day retention rate between the experimental group and the control group is not significant, which indicates that moving the first threshold from level 30 to level 40 has no significant effect on the 1-day retention rate.
- Retention 7-day: The difference in 7-day retention rate between the experimental group and the control group is significant, which indicates that moving the first threshold from level 30 to level 40 has a significant effect on the 7-day retention rate.

Therefore, considering the experimental results, we conclude that under our experimental conditions, moving the first threshold from level 30 to level 40 has no significant effect on player retention and game rounds. It also means that players may not be affected in terms of game experience due to the movement of the threshold.

We successfully optimized the game threshold, enhanced the user experience, and increased the user conversion rate, contributing positively to the company's revenue growth. The data-driven approach and collaborative teamwork were instrumental in achieving these results.
